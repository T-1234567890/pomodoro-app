# How to Open Pomodoro App If macOS Gatekeeper Blocks It

Due to macOS security policies, apps downloaded from the internet that are not signed or from the App Store may be blocked by **Gatekeeper**.  
This is a normal security feature and does *not* mean the app is harmful.

You can safely allow Pomodoro App to run by following the steps below.

---

## 1. Move the App to the Applications Folder

Before opening the app for the first time, please move it to your **Applications** folder:

1. After downloading the `.zip` from the Releases page, unzip it.
2. **Drag the "Pomodoro App" icon into your Applications folder**.
3. This step ensures the app is in a trusted location and reduces interruptions.

## 2. First Launch

1. Open **Finder** and go to your **Applications** folder.
2. Double-click on **Pomodoro App**.
3. macOS may show a message like:  
   > “Pomodoro App can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.”

---

## 3. Allow the App in System Settings

1. Open **System Settings** (or **System Preferences**) on your Mac.
2. Navigate to **Privacy & Security**.
3. Scroll down to the **Security** section.
4. Look for a message like:  
   > “Pomodoro App was blocked from opening.”
5. Click **Allow Anyway** or **Open Anyway**.
6. Try opening the app again from the Applications folder.

> 📌 This does *not* turn off Gatekeeper for other apps — only permits this specific app.

## 4. What This Means

- Gatekeeper is a built-in macOS security feature that protects against harmful software.
- Because Pomodoro App is currently distributed via GitHub Releases and not signed by Apple yet, Gatekeeper may block it initially.
- Following the steps above lets you open the app safely on your machine.
- You do *not* need to disable Gatekeeper globally.

## 5. Need More Help?

If you’re still having trouble opening the app:
- Check that the downloaded file is intact
- Ensure you are running on macOS 14.6 or higher
- Reach out via the project’s **Issues/Discussion** page

### Enjoy using Pomodoro App! 😊
