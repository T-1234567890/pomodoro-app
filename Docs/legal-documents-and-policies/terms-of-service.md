## 1. Introduction

Pomodoro App ("we," "our," or "the Service") provides a macOS productivity application and an official website at https://pomodoro-app.tech. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of both the Pomodoro App macOS application and the pomodoro-app.tech website (together, the "Service").

We aim for clear, practical terms that match the experience of using the Service. Please read these Terms carefully and keep a copy for your records.

### What These Terms Cover

These Terms apply to:

- **The macOS application** (including builds distributed via TestFlight, the App Store, and other distribution channels we make available)
- **Our website** at https://pomodoro-app.tech

These Terms do not replace third-party terms that may apply to parts of the Service (for example, Apple’s or Google’s terms). Those third-party terms are addressed in the Third-party Services section.

### Definitions

For readability, we use the following key terms:

- **"Pomodoro App"** means the Pomodoro App macOS application.
- **"Website"** means https://pomodoro-app.tech and any pages we operate under that domain.
- **"Service"** means the Pomodoro App and the Website, including related features, updates, and support channels we make available.
- **"User"** means anyone who accesses or uses the Service.
- **"Beta Builds"** means pre-release or preview versions of Pomodoro App, including TestFlight builds.
- **"User Content"** means tasks, notes, text, files, or other information you create, upload, or store through the Service (if any).
- **"Feedback"** means suggestions, ideas, bug reports, or other input you provide about the Service.

## 2. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

If you use the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to accept these Terms on its behalf and that your organization will be responsible for your use of the Service.

If you do not accept these Terms, your only remedy is to stop using the Service and uninstall the application.

---

## 3. Eligibility / User Requirements

You must be able to form a legally binding agreement and comply with applicable laws to use the Service. The Service is not intended for use by anyone who is prohibited from receiving services under applicable law.

You are responsible for:

- Using the Service in compliance with applicable laws and regulations
- Ensuring your device, network, and account credentials (if any) are secure
- Reviewing these Terms and the Privacy Policy from time to time for updates

If you are under the age required to consent to digital services in your jurisdiction, you may use the Service only with the involvement of a parent or legal guardian to the extent required by law.

**Software License.**  
Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download, install, and use the Pomodoro App macOS application for your personal or internal use on Apple-branded devices you own or control, in accordance with applicable laws and the rules of the distribution channel you obtained it from (for example, TestFlight or the App Store).

**Website Access.**  
We grant you permission to access and use the Website for personal or internal informational purposes, provided you comply with these Terms.

**No Transfer.**

---

## 6. User Content / Feedback

### User Content

The Service may allow you to create, store, or display User Content such as tasks, notes, or other information. As between you and us, you retain ownership of your User Content.

You are responsible for your User Content and for ensuring you have the rights to submit it and use it with the Service. You agree that your User Content will not:

- Violate applicable laws
- Infringe intellectual property rights or other rights of third parties
- Contain malicious code or attempt to compromise the Service

**License to Operate the Service.**  
If you choose to use features that store or transmit User Content through online functionality (if available), you grant us a limited license to host, store, transmit, and display your User Content solely to operate, maintain, and improve the Service and to provide the features you choose to use.

**Backups and Data Loss.**  
You are responsible for keeping appropriate backups of important User Content. Even with best practices, data can be lost due to device issues, software bugs, configuration changes, or network failures.

### Feedback

If you provide Feedback, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, and incorporate that Feedback into the Service without compensation to you.

We are not obligated to implement Feedback.

## 7. Updates and Modifications

### App Updates

The Pomodoro App macOS application may receive updates, upgrades, patches, or other changes that add, remove, or modify features. Updates may be delivered through distribution channels such as TestFlight, the App Store, or other mechanisms. You may need to install updates to continue using certain features.

### Beta Builds (TestFlight)

If you use Beta Builds, you acknowledge that Beta Builds may be unstable, may contain bugs, and may change over time. You should avoid relying on Beta Builds for critical workflows. Apple’s TestFlight service is governed by Apple’s applicable terms and policies.

### Service Changes

We may change the Service over time for operational reasons, product improvements, security, legal compliance, or other reasons. We do not guarantee that any specific feature will always be available, that the Service will always be available, or that it will be compatible with every device, operating system version, or browser.

---

## 8. Third-party Services

The Service may rely on, integrate with, or link to third-party services. Your use of third-party services may be subject to their own terms and policies. We do not control third-party services and are not responsible for their content, availability, or practices.

### Firebase

Pomodoro App may use Firebase services (provided by Google) for functions such as authentication or related account features. When you use features that depend on Firebase, relevant information may be processed by Firebase in accordance with their terms and privacy practices.

### Apple services

If you use the Service through Apple distribution or platform features (such as TestFlight, the App Store, Apple ID, notifications, or other Apple platform services), Apple may process certain information under Apple's terms and privacy policies. Apple is not a party to these Terms.

### Purchases (if applicable)

If the Service offers paid features, subscriptions, or in-app purchases, payments may be handled by the platform through which you obtain the Service (for example, the App Store). Refunds and billing disputes may be governed by the platform’s applicable terms and policies. We do not receive or store full payment card details when a platform processes payment on your behalf.

### External integrations

The Service may support optional integrations with external providers (for example, calendars, reminders, or music services) when enabled by you. Any such integrations are provided for convenience and may be subject to the provider’s terms and policies.

### AI providers (if enabled)

If the Service includes AI features and you enable them, limited inputs may be processed using third-party AI providers. AI outputs may be inaccurate or incomplete, and you are responsible for verifying outputs before relying on them. Details about data handling are described in the Privacy Policy.

## 9. Disclaimer of Warranties

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis and without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, or that defects will be corrected. You are responsible for maintaining appropriate backups of your data and for securing your device and accounts.

**No Professional Advice.**  
The Service is provided for general productivity and informational purposes. It does not provide medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you.

---

## 10. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or service interruption, arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the Service.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total liability for any claim relating to the Service will not exceed the amount you paid us (if any) for the Service in the twelve (12) months before the event giving rise to the claim.

If you paid nothing for the Service, our total liability will be limited to a nominal amount (for example, USD $10) or the minimum amount permitted by law, whichever is greater.

Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability for certain damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you.

---

## 11. Termination

You may stop using the Service at any time.

We may suspend or terminate access to the Service if we reasonably believe your use violates these Terms, creates security risk, causes harm to the Service or other users, or is necessary to comply with law or protect rights. When practical, we may provide notice and an opportunity to address the issue, but we are not required to do so in all circumstances.

Upon termination, the license granted to you under these Terms will end. Sections that by their nature should survive termination (including disclaimers, limitation of liability, intellectual property, and governing law) will survive.

---

## 12. Intellectual Property

The Service (including software, code, design, text, graphics, and other materials) is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws.

### Open-source components

Pomodoro App may include open-source software. Open-source components are licensed under their applicable licenses, and those licenses may grant you additional rights. In the event of a conflict between an open-source license and these Terms with respect to a specific open-source component, the open-source license will control for that component.

### Trademarks

Third-party names, logos, and trademarks are the property of their respective owners and are used for identification purposes only.
