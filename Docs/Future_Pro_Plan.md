# Pomodoro App · Future Pro Plan (Long-Term future planning-draft)

> ⚠️ This document describes **long-term, forward-looking ideas** for Pomodoro App.  
> None of the features below are implemented today, and **no payment is required** at the current stage.

Pomodoro App started as a lightweight, local macOS focus tool.  
Over time, the project may gradually explore features that require **cloud services, AI APIs, or ongoing infrastructure costs**.

This document exists to:
- Share transparent long-term thinking
- Collect early feedback
- Avoid surprise paywalls in the future

---

## Status Summary

- Current version: **v1.1.x**
- Distribution: GitHub Releases (unsigned)
- Business model: **Free and Open source**
- Pro plan: **Not launched / Not scheduled**

This is a **future concept**, not a commitment.

---

## Why a Pro Plan Might Exist (In the Far Future)

Some ideas under exploration go beyond what a fully local, offline app can reasonably support long-term:

- AI-assisted scheduling and summaries
- Cross-device data synchronization
- Social or comparative features (e.g. leaderboards)
- Long-term data aggregation

These introduce **real, recurring costs** (API usage, servers, maintenance).  
A Pro plan would exist only to **sustain development**, not to restrict core usage.

---

## Possible Pro Features (Exploratory)

> All items below are **ideas**, not promises.

### 1. AI-Assisted Planning & Reflection
- Automatic time-block suggestions based on tasks and calendar gaps
- Daily / weekly focus summaries
- Lightweight insights (overload detection, consistency trends)

> Requires external AI APIs → likely Pro-only if implemented.

---

### 2. Advanced Productivity Analytics
- Extended charts across weeks or months
- Pattern recognition (focus vs. distraction)
- Long-term trend analysis

> Visualization would remain local; aggregation may use cloud storage.

---

### 3. Optional Cloud Sync
- Cross-device sync (initially via iCloud)
- Backup & restore
- Optional account-based sync for non-Apple platforms (exploratory)

---

### 4. Personalization & Focus Environment
- Custom home backgrounds or images
- Extended theming options
- Advanced “Flow” focus modes (non-Pomodoro)

---

## What Is Expected to Stay Free

The goal is to keep Pomodoro App **useful without payment**:

- Core timer & focus features
- Task, calendar, and Reminders integration
- Menu bar support
- Local data storage

The app should never become unusable without Pro.

---

## Privacy & Philosophy

- Free usage remains local-first
- Pro features minimize data collection
- No selling user data
- AI requests are scoped and non-persistent
- No dark patterns or forced upgrades

---

## Estimated Pricing (Very Early Draft)

> Pricing below is **not finalized** and may change significantly.

- **US/International (USD)**
  - $3.99–$4.99/month
  - $29–$39/year

- **China (RMB)**
  - ¥29/month
  - ¥229/year

Final pricing may change based on real costs.

---

## Final Notes

This plan represents **directional thinking**, not a roadmap.

Pomodoro App is developed as a long-term project:
- Stability over growth hacks
- Sustainability over rapid monetization
- Transparency over surprise changes

Feedback and discussion are welcome.
